                Tracklete is designed to give athletes a helpful tool to improve and track their speed. Quality coaching
                is a privelage that many athletes take for granted, and many more athletes wish they had access too.
                Tracklete aims to provide free, top of the line coaching, to all athletes in the world. The speedometer
                application allows athletes to view their speed over a period of time, allowing them to
                track their progress or show off to their friends. Thank you for
                using Tracklete.
